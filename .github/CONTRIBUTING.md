   - **Windows**:
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
4. Install dependencies:

   uv sync
   ```
5. Run the project:

   ```sh
   uv run ooo.py
   ```

6. Install git hooks:

   ```sh

   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

### Commit message rules

Consider following the below format for the commit message:

Commit Type : `build|chore|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|revert|style|test`

> ðŸ”” **Note**: To trigger automatic releases via GitHub Actions, use `feat:`, `fix:`, or other release-related types. `chore:` commits will be ignored by default.

**Examples**

- feat: create a new feature.
- fix: resolve a bug.
- style: apply code style changes (e.g., formatting).

### Using Commitizen

This project uses [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) to standardize commit messages and enable automated versioning and changelog generation.

Instead of manually typing commit messages, you can run:

```sh
cz commit
```

This will guide you through an interactive prompt to compose a conventional commit message, ensuring compatibility with our release automation system.

> ðŸ’¡ **Reminder**: Commit messages using `feat:`, `fix:`, or `perf:` will trigger automatic version bumps and changelog generation via GitHub Actions (`release-please`).

If you prefer to write your own commit messages, please follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:

```
<type>(optional-scope): description
```

**Examples:**

- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support`
- `fix(api): handle timeout edge case`
- `refactor: simplify data parser logic`

Releases are handled automatically via GitHub Actions and [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), based on your commit history.

> ðŸ’¡ You do not need to run `cz bump` manually â€” versioning and changelogs are managed automatically.
